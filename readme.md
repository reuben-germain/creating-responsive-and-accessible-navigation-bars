##### There a five possible link states, and they must be in this particular order. (YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE EACH ONE OF THE LINKS IN THE DOCUMENT, BUT WHICH EVER ONES YOU DO USE THEY NEED TO BE KEPT IN A VERY STRICT ORDER FOR THE INHERITANCE & CASSCADE TO WORK CORRECTLY. THIS IS BEST PRACTICE)
- :link -- before you've viewed the site
- :visited -- you've viewed the site before
- :focus -- when the element is selected
- :hover -- when you hover over it
- :active -- after the link is clicked, before the next page loads
